= Motivation

Sometimes serialize methods for AR did not work form me - instead of serializing to YAML, it was saving values as DB Strings (i.e. true was serialized to "t").
It usually happened in AR callbacks... weird...

= Result

Use serialized instead of serialize to worry no more

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

    serialized :some_column_name, :another_column_name

    #...

    end
